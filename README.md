 What I learned: 
 What I learned most in this project is how to get the integer split from a string so that I can use that as a value for it's child and make effective changes.  
 I learned about the Margin:right and Margin:left features to slop only the "end cap" elements to be rounded.  
 I learned how to use dayJS and and how easy Bootstrap can be for things like jumbotron and cols.  (It made something that would have taken hours in CSS for me to accomplish take a few minutes.)
